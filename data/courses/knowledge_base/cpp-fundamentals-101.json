My name is Mike in this course, I'm going to be teaching you guys everything you need to know to get started writing c++, c++ is one of the most popular programming languages around. And for good reason. It's an awesome programming language, it's actually a language that is closely related to the C programming language. (00:39) In fact, c++ is essentially just like the next level of the C programming language. So if you're already familiar with the C programming language, then you're gonna have no problem picking up c++. But even if you're not c++ is a great first programming language to learn. And in this course, I'm going to teach you guys all of the core concepts.",

So we'll start looking at things like variables. (01:47) And we'll work with data, we'll even write a couple of different programs and some little games. And then we're really going to get into the thick of it, we're going to learn all sorts of different programming structures, things like loops, and if statements and classes and objects, it's going to be awesome, we're going to cover all of the core concepts, not just in c++, but all the core concepts for programming in general. (02:32)  So the knowledge you learn in this course will actually be able to carry over to potentially other programming languages as well.",

And it's a good first language to learn if you're just getting into programming. (03:07)  So stick around for this course, you can kind of work through the videos at your own pace. And hopefully you guys can learn something about this awesome language c++. In this tutorial, I'm going to show you guys how to get everything set up to start working with c++. So in order to start working with c++, and started writing programs, and doing all that fun stuff, we actually have to do a little bit of setup, we're actually going to need two things on our computer. (04:04)  The first thing we're going to need is a text editor. And we're basically just going to use this text editor in order to write our c++ programs, any text editor is going to work.",

(04:51)  And we can use that text editor. It's basically just a an environment that's really awesome for writing c++ code. And then we're also going to need in addition to a text editor, we're going to need a program called a compiler, specifically a c++ compiler. And this is a program that will basically take the c++ code that we write, and it will translate it or transform it into a language that the computer is going to be able to understand. (05:44)  So as long as we have a text editor, and we have our c++ compiler, then we're ready to start programming in c++. So I'm going to show you guys how to get all that set up.",

And you'll see there's a few options one says download the binary release, download the source code, we're going to click download the binary release. (07:07) And this is going to bring us to this page, you can see there's a link over here for Windows XP, Vista, seven, eight, etc. There's also links for Linux and Mac, let's click on this windows option.

So let's go ahead and download this, I'm just going to come over here and click on this link for SourceForge. (08:33)  And this should start downloading the file onto our computer.

So the first thing I want to do is show you guys how to get that compiler. And it's possible that if you're on Mac, you might already have it.

(13:45)  So I'm just gonna click Enter. And I already have these installed. So these are like command line tools, you can see I already have them installed.

Generally, whenever we're going to run a program in c++, we're going to build the program. And then we're going to run the program. Building the program basically means that we're taking all this code over here, and we're converting it down into a language that the computer can understand.

But a lot of times, if you just wrote some new code, and you want to test it out, you can just click this build and run option.

In next tutorial, we're going to talk about like, what all this stuff is, we're going to look at writing some of our own instructions, maybe modifying these instructions.

And basically, what this means is we're ending the line where we're going to print out text. So you'll notice that we printed out hello world. And then on the next line, we printed out Mike. So using these little print statements, I'm actually going to show you guys how we can write a little program that's going to draw a shape out onto the screen. (32:55)  So I'm actually going to go ahead and get rid of this text. And I'm just going to copy this guy here a couple times. So we'll make like four of these.

(34:08) And each of these instructions is telling c++ that we want to print out a different line onto the console. So now when I run my program, you'll see we're actually printing out this little triangle. This is a very basic program. But you'll see just by using those four simple instructions, we were able to actually draw something out onto the screen. (34:47) So let's talk about this.

(36:00)  So we're giving the computer a bunch of instructions that we want it to carry out. So imagine that, for example, in real life, like you were using a recipe or something, a recipe is a lot like a program, a recipe has a list of instructions. And if you follow those instructions correctly, then you end up with like something delicious.

So it's going to start with this instruction. (38:03)  And basically here we're just telling the computer over telling c++ that we want to print this line of text out onto the screen.

Let's say we want to change the character's name to john, right, so I can change it to john. (43:32)  I'll keep looking through the story down here. It also says George, so I'll change it to john.

So the way we can create a character variable is just by saying CH, ar. And now I want to give this a name. So let's just call it like grade or something. And whenever we create a character, we're going to use these single quotation marks. (1:05:36)  So I can store any like regular character that I would want inside of here. So you know, essentially any character that you can think of, you could store in here, and then we're going to include this semicolon. So that's basically like the character data type. And in addition to just storing one single character, there's going to be a lot of situations where we're going to want to store like more than one. (1:06:17)  And what we can actually do is use something called a string. And a string is basically just a string of characters.",

And now we're going to be able to store instead of just one character, a bunch of different characters. So there's different situations where you might want to use either like a char or a string. (1:07:34)  But for the most part, I think strings are probably a little bit more commonly used than chars. So instead of just plain text, we can also store and work with numbers. So essentially, there's two different types of numbers are two basic types of numbers. There's whole numbers, and then there's decimal numbers.",

You know, basically a number that has a decimal point after it. (1:08:46)  When we work with these different numbers, c++ is actually going to distinguish between them. So the first type a number we can work with is an integer. So I could just say int, and this could be like an age or something. So whenever we're creating a number, we can just type out the number so I could say like 15. (1:09:20)  And you'll notice I don't need any quotation marks. I don't need anything special surrounding this, I can just type out the number. In addition to positive numbers.",

And this basically just stands for like floating point number. The second one is called double. Now you'll hear different people talk about these different data types, the main difference is just how many decimal points they can store. (1:10:42)  So a double can store more decimal points than a float. So if you need a number to be very specific, as far as like how many decimal points you can take it to, then you definitely want to use a double.

So it doesn't have to be like a different number decimal. And again, you can make these negative, that's no problem. (1:12:09)  So ants are going to be what we're going to use for whole numbers, for the most part doubles are going to be what we're going to use for decimal numbers. So that covers text and numbers. And just with those two data types. With text, we can use characters and strings and an instant doubles. You can represent like just about any type of information in your programs.

And this will basically tell us whether or not someone is male. So in my case, I couldsay true, because I am a male, right. (1:14:16)  So you'll see how this can kind of come in handy for different things like, we could say something is true, or we could say something is false.

So down here, you'll see I have this little program set up basically just printing out a couple lines.

(1:39:00)  So I think for now, that should be a good introduction into working with strings in c++. In this tutorial, I want to talk to you guys about working with numbers in C. Now whenever you're writing programs, and C, one of the most common types of data that you're going to be dealing with are going to be numbers. (1:39:36)  So these can be things like whole numbers or decimal numbers. Basically, I'm gonna give you guys a full overview of how to work with numbers, we'll talk about the basics, we'll look at how we can use different mathematical functions in order to do different mathematical operations with our numbers. So this is gonna be a pretty cool tutorial. (1:40:20) Now, down here, I'm just going to talk to you guys about the basics.",

And decimal numbers can be referred to as two things either floats or doubles. And essentially, the only thing you need to know about that as a beginner is that doubles allow you to store more specific decimal points. (1:41:11) So the double you can store you know, potentially more decimal points and you In a float, and there's more differences. But if you want to get more into that you can kind of look it up. But the basics of using numbers as you just type them out. So if I wanted to, for example, print out the number 14, you see I have this C out here, I can just type it in and we can print it out, we can work with it. (1:42:09)  In addition to positive numbers, we could use negative numbers, if I wanted, I can make this a decimal. So really, numbers are very simple, you just kind of type out the number.",

And in addition to printing out five and seven, this is actually going to do this math operation. (1:42:47)  So this will actually print out the result of five plus seven. So you can see we get 12 over here. So we can use addition, we can also use subtraction, we could use division, which is going to be this forward slash, and we can use multiplication, which is going to be this Asterix, so if I was to multiply these two numbers, now you'll see over here we get 35. (1:43:32)  So those are the four basic math, you know operations. So that's going to work really well. Also, one other thing I want to show you guys, which is called the modulus operator, and the modulus operator will basically give us the remainder of dividing two numbers.",

So now we just we should just get one. And you can see over here we get one. So sometimes that modules operator can come in handy, you can also represent order of operations in C. (1:45:16)  So C is going to adhere to like the normal or reparations, like p DMS, I think it is Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally, basically like multiplication and division are going to come before addition and subtraction. So if I said for example, like four plus five times 10, this is going to do five times 10 first, so it's going to be 50 plus four, so we get 54.",

So in addition to doing all that stuff, and just printing out numbers, we can store numbers inside of variables. So I can make an N, we'll just call it like w nom for whole number. And we'll just make this five. I could also use like a double. And this will be like de nom for decimal number. (1:47:03)  And this would be like 5.5, right? I mean, now we're storing these numbers inside of variables. If I wanted, I could just, you know, print them out.

(1:48:11)  There's a lot of situations where you want to increment a value. You could also do like minus minus, and that will subtract one from it. You could also do like w plus equals, and we could say like 80. And so what this is going to do is it's going to take w nom and it's going to add 80 to it. So now we should get 85.

Let's say I came down here and I added 5.5 plus nine, so I'm adding a decimal number. And I'm adding it to a integer number, right, so let's see what happens over here, you'll see that we're going to get a decimal number back. So anytime we're doing math between a decimal number like a double or a float, and an integer, a whole number, we're always going to get a decimal number back. (1:50:12)  So it's always going to give us the decimal back. But it's important to note though, if I did math with two integers, so for example, let me show you guys if I was to say like 10 divided by three, and these are both integers. Keep in mind, I'm actually going to get an integer number back. (1:50:50)  So we're going to get like three back because that's technically the answer. But here's the thing.

So it's going to be three with three repeated just like that. So you can see if we do math between just two integers, we're always getting an integer back, even if that's not like fully the correct answer. And different circumstances, you're going to want to do that in other circumstances you're not, but just keep that in mind. (1:52:18)  So that's kind of how integers and decimal numbers interact with each other. So now what I want to do is show you guys how we can use different math operations.

But for now, I'm going to show you some basic math functions that we can use. (1:53:35)  In order to use these math functions, I actually have to do something called importing them. Andessentially, when we import something, we're basically going we're telling c++ that we need to go out and grab code from other files. So up here, you can see we're using this include statement, and we're grabbing something called iostream, I'm going to add another line here, we're just going to put a hashtag, we're basically just going to copy this guy up here.

(1:55:13)  So down here, we can now use a bunch of different math functions, essentially just math operations. So for example, I could say like POW. And what this will do is it'll take two arguments. So in here, I could pass two numbers, like I could pass a two, and I could pass a five. And what this will do is it'll take two raised to the power of five, and it's just going to print that out. (1:56:01)  So when I run my program, you'll see we're getting 32. So 32 is two raised to the fifth power. And you can kind of do that with any number. So I could also say like three raised to the third power, so three cubed, and now we should get 27, which we do. So that POW function can be pretty useful.",

(1:57:04)  So I can put both integers like whole numbers and also decimal numbers. There's another one which is called round, which is going to round a number. So if I put like 4.3 inside of here, this will return the rounded number. So you see, we just get four and this will follow normal rounding rules. So if I change this to 4. (1:57:37) 6, now we should get five back. There's a couple other these functions, which will similarly like round decimal numbers, I can say CIO, and what this will do is it'll automatically just round the number up.

So those can be pretty useful. And there's one more I want to show you guys, which is called f max. And f Max is going to take two numbers. (1:58:47)  So I can pass in like a three and a 10. And this will tell me which one's bigger. So this will return back to us the bigger of the two numbers. So now when I run this program, you'll see it's giving us a 10 back because 10 was the bigger number and a lot of circumstances, in C, you're going to have two numbers, you might not know which one is bigger. (1:59:32)  So this can be really useful to tell us. And you could also use f min, which will do the opposite. So this will tell us what the smallest number that we passed in was.

(2:02:40)  So whenever I'm asking the user to give me a piece of information, if they give me that information, and I don't put it anywhere, like it's kind of useless, right, so we usually what we want to do is create a variable.

So for example, I can come over here I can say like john smith, and now when I click enter, it says hello, john smith. So that's how we can get strings of text. And that's really the difference is if I wanted to get like an integer and store it inside of an integer variable, if I wanted to get a char and store it inside of a char variable, I have to use C in.",

And so you know, you can essentially like copy this whole line, paste it a bunch of times below there, and get, you know a bunch of different pieces of information and use them. (2:13:11) In this tutorial, I'm going to show you guys how to build a basic calculator in c++. Essentially, we're going to build a calculator where the user can enter in two numbers. And then we'll add those numbers together and will spit out the answer. So this is going to be kind of cool. (2:13:48)  And it'll show you guys a little bit more about getting input from users.

And they're the same data type, I can actually put them on the same line. So I could say num, one, comma, num, two. And a lot of people find this to be really useful. So for example, I could do like as many as I wanted. (2:15:18)  In our case, we're just going to have two numbers, though. So now that we've declared our two number variables, the next thing we want to do is prompt the user and get some information. So I'm going to say C out.

(2:16:32)  So at this point in our program, we should have both of those numbers, we should have gotten both of those numbers from the user, the last thing we want to do is just print out the answer.

But I guess that does kind of highlight a common mistake for beginners in c++. (2:18:15)  And even for someone like me who's programmed in c++ a lot before. Alright, so now let's run our program. And it says enter first number, so enter in a five, enter second number entered and a 10. And now when I click enter, it should add both these numbers together. So it does and we get 15. So that's pretty cool. (2:18:49)  Another thing we could do is instead of using integers, we could also just use doubles. And that's as easy as just changing these variable declarations.

(2:21:33)  And generally since you entered in random words, the story ends up being pretty funny. So let me show you guys over here in my browser, I just have an example of a Madlibyou know, essentially there's this story and then you would sprinkle in all those random words that the person entered into the story. So we're going to build something like this in our c++ program. (2:22:05)  Down here, I have my little program set up. It's just this little poem, it says Roses are red, violets are blue. I love you.

So let's get started, this should be kind of cool. (2:23:22)  The first thing we want to do is actually create variables for all these things. So I'm just going to say string. And we'll create a variable for the color for the plural noun and for the celebrity.

(2:30:08)  But unlike a variable arrays can hold multiple data values. So an array could hold like a list of you know, 1000s, or millions of pieces of information.

So after lucky nums, we're gonna put this open and close square bracket.

(2:42:51)  So whenever we're creating a function in c++, we need to give c++ a couple pieces of information, the first piece of information we need to give is called a return type. Now whenever we create these functions, a lot of times the functions will go off, they'll perform a specific task, and then they'll return a value back to the caller. (2:43:27) And we're actually going to talk more about returns and return types in the next video. But for the purposes of this video, you can kind of just follow along. And I'm just going to go ahead and put void here. And when we put void here, it basically means that this function is not going to return anything. So this is kind of like the most basic type of function. (2:44:14)  And after we put void, now we need to give this function a name.",

And after this, I'm going to make an open and closed curly bracket. Any code that I put inside of this open and close curly bracket is going to be considered inside of the function. So inside of here, why don't we just say like C out, and we'll just print out like Hello, user. And that's basically all we'll do. (2:45:35)  So this is a very simple function, I just have one line of code in here, I can have as many lines as I want. This is a simple function.

So this Say hi function, I can give this a piece of information. And the Say hi function can use that piece of information to, you know, performance task differently or better or whatever. (2:50:44)  So these are called parameters. And if I want to specify that this Say hi function should be given a piece of information, I can just come over here and specify what piece of information it should take.

And you can take any piece of information as a parameter, and you can also take multiple parameters. (2:52:43) So why don't we specify another parameter like age, so now the caller is going to have to pass in their name and their age. So now we can say hello name, will say like you are.

So in c++, we can write functions which are basically like little containers that store a bunch of code that performs a specific task.

So if I was to say like, two cubed, it's basically just two raised to the third power, or it's just going to be two times two times two, right? That's what cubing a number does. So why don't we create a c++ function that's going to cube a number. Now when we create a function in c++, the first thing that we have to do is declare something called a return type.

(3:16:55) So now in addition to izmail, I also have is tall. So let's say that we wanted to check to see if the person was both male. And if they were tall, so down here, what I can do is I can use something called the AND operator I could say is male, and is tall.

Here's the thing, though, if I set one of these to false, so if I set his tall to false, this whole condition is no longer going to be true. So then we're going to go down here to this else block. And this should probably say, like, you are not male, or not tall, but we'll just leave it like that just for demonstration purposes. (3:19:07) Alright, so now it says you are not male, right.

And yeah, so it's still going to be able to return 200. So there is our max function. And hopefully this gives you guys a little introduction into using comparisons. Now we can compare all different types of data. (3:48:47)  So using these comparison operators, we can compare integers, we can also compare like doubles and floats, and we can compare characters. So you can compare all those guys just by using all that stuff in there. In this tutorial, I'm going to show you guys how to build a four function calculator in c++. (3:49:26)  Now, if you've been following along with this course, you'll know that in the beginning of the course, we created a very simple calculator. And basically, that calculator was able to take in two numbers as input, and added them together and printed out the answer.",

(3:50:26)  So this calculator is going to allow the user to enter in two numbers, but it's also going to allow the user to specify which operation they want to perform. So they can specify that they want to add the numbers and multiply the numbers, divide them, multiply them, whatever. So it's essentially going to be a more powerful calculator. (3:51:04) So down here, inside of my main function, I want to start writing the code for this. And the first thing I'm going to do is create a few variables. So I want to create a couple variables. And why don't we just create these as and you could also make these doubles, if you wanted. (3:51:38)  We'll just call them num one and node two. And these are going to represent the two numbers that we want to perform the operation on. And then down here, we're also going to want to create a character.",

(3:52:16)  So it's either going to be plus or minus division, or multiplication. Alright, so now that we've created those two variables, we want to start writing the code to get the input from the user. The first thing that we want to do is print out a prompt, so I'm just going to say C out. (3:52:52)  And I'll basically just print out enter first number, so we'll prompt them to enter in the first number. And then down here, we're going to use C in and remember you want to these, these two greater than signs. And we want to store the user's input inside of num one, just like that. Okay, cool. So now that we got num, one, I'm actually just going to copy this code, and then down here, we can paste it two more times. (3:53:36)  So down here, we're going to ask them for the operator.",

(3:54:20)  So we're going to get that first number, we're going to get the operator and then we're going to get the second number. So they'd give me like five plus two, or six divided by seven or something like that. Alright, so now that we have all of that information, we have one more thing that we need to do, which is we need to figure out what the user wants to do. (3:54:59)  Right over here, we have the operator. So ideally, they would have entered in like a plus sign a minus sign, whatever, but we don't know what exactly they entered in like we don't we have no idea what what they were going to enter in. So we need to figure that out.",

And we need to put a condition in here. So basically, what we want to do is want to figure out what that operator is. So the first thing I'm gonna do is just check to see if the operator is equal to a plus sign. (3:56:20)  Right? So if the operator is equal to a plus sign, then we're basically just going to print out the result of adding the two numbers together. So why don't we come up here, and I'm going to create an integer called result. And then down here, we'll set resultequal to num, one plus num, two. And we know that we want to add them because if this condition is true, then we're going to execute this code. So now let's do an ls F.

And now we'll say okay, is equal to forward slash, that means division. And then one more time, we're going to do this for multiplication. So use this Asterix, and then here we're going to multiply the two numbers. So now we're basically covering all of the operators. (3:58:39)  So they enter in a plus sign, and we got that covered minus sign, division sign and multiplication sign, right, we can cover all of those standard scenarios, but there's always the chance that the user entered in an invalid operator.",

Alright, so basically, by the end of this, if block, we should have a value stored inside of result. (4:00:07)  So down here, we'll just going to print it out. So I'll just say C out, and we'll print out result. Alright, so let's see if our program works. I'm going to go ahead and run the program. And it says enter first numbers, why don't we insert a five?
