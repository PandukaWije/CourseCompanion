So let's get started (02:43) I am going to come over to my web browser and I'm just gonna go up to the Google search bar. And I'm gonna search for a program called code block.

And that's basically what these C programs are It's a set of instructions that when executed correctly will result in the computer doing something for us and one of the cool things about computers is that we can program them to do anything and C is one of the best languages to do that with so let's look at this instruction over here It's called print F and this prints something out onto the screen.",

(20:34) In this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about variables in C Now when we're using C programming language a lot of times we're gonna be dealing with data so there's gonna be different data values or different information that we're gonna want to keep track of and use inside of our programs and Sometimes it can be difficult to maintain and keep track of all that data and that's where variables come in a variable is Essentially a container where we can store different pieces of information so different data values (21:03) we could sort of things like numbers or texts or characters and These variables make it a lot easier for us to keep track of and manage all the data in our program So I'm gonna show you guys basically how variables can be useful and how we can use them in our C programs But down here.",

We always just want to type out the number (33:38) So you'll notice I'm not putting quotation marks or parentheses or anything around this I'm just typing out the number like that.

I could print out a specific piece of information and generally when we're using printf We're gonna be printing out Text so I can make an open and closed quotation marks and I could print out like hello world in here And now this will print out onto the screen.",

So maybe you know, this was like a really complex line of code We could use this text in order to explain it You can also use comments to do something called commenting out a line of code So for example, let's say I wanted to run my program but I didn't want to have this line of code in there Well one thing I could do would just be to delete the entire line of code Right so I could delete this code and now I can run my program and it's no longer gonna print it out (53:44) It's no longer gonna do anything.",

I had to actually delete the of code so instead of deleting it I could just bring it back and I could comment it out so I could basically surround it with these comment tags and Now the computer is just gonna ignore it.

It won't execute that line of code But I didn't have to actually delete the line. I could just comment it out So a lot of times when you're writing programs You might want to try to run your program without a certain line or a certain you know series of lines of code and instead of deleting them and then running the program you can just comment them out and See will basically ignore them so that can be really useful So those are the two basic uses for comments and essentially comments are open, right?

(1:25:36) Specifically huge amounts of information that are related right imagine I had a list of like a bunch of names or a list of a bunch of numbers that I needed to keep track of Let's say I had like a list of a hundred numbers, right? I wouldn't want to have to create a hundred different variables to store all of those different numbers and this is where arrays come in an array is essentially a Data structure where we can store a bunch of different data values So inside of an array unlike a variable where I can only store one value I could store hundreds or thousands or even millions (1:26:01) of values So inside of a single array, I could store like five things or seven things or ten numbers or twenty characters, you know I could sort a bunch of different pieces of information and then all that information would be nice and neat and Organized in my program so I'm gonna show you guys how to create arrays We can create an array a lot Like we create a normal variable and a variable in array are very similar variable is basically used to define a container that Stores a single value and an array is used to define a container that stores, you know any number of values (1:26:43) So the first thing we're gonna have to do when we create an array is give C some Information and the first piece of information is what type of data we want to store inside of the array so for example I could say int and now I'd be creating an array that would hold integers If I said char, I'd be creating an array that would hold characters Or if I said like double the same thing but for double numbers, so why don't we create an array of integers? And I'm just gonna call this lucky numbers whenever I create an array (1:27:23) I always want to use a special little symbol and this symbol will tell see that instead of just creating a normal Variable we want to an array and it's an open and closed Square brackets whenever I use these open and close square brackets after the name.",

You might think that 4 would be at index position 1 because it's the first element in the array but in C we start array indexes at 0 so actually the first (1:30:19) element this 4 is gonna be at index position 0 so if I was going to write out indexesI would say like 4 is at index position 0 this 8 is at index position 1 this 15 is at index position 2 16 is a 10x position 3 etc So that's gonna allow me to access all these elements inside of the array Individually, so I could print them out just by referring to the index inside of these square brackets Another thing I can do is I can modify some of the elements inside of here so Let's say I want to modify lucky numbers in x position 1 so let's say I want to modify this 8 (1:30:49) so I don't like this 8 anymore so I can basically just assign this a different value like I normally would so I could say lucky numbers and I can make an opening close square bracket we can say 1 and I can just set it equal to something else so I could set this equal to like 200 and Now when we print out lucky numbers 1 instead of printing out an 8.",

(1:44:44) You're taking it to the third power So I'm gonna make a function that's gonna do that basically This function will accept one parameter which is gonna be a number and it'll cube that number and then once it's done cubing the number, it'll give That value back to the caller and you guys will see how that will work So I do want to point out one thing whenever we are Returning values in our function.",

So basically this variable result now (1:46:53) represents or now stores the cubed value of num all we need to do to return this value now is just say return Result and this return keyword is basically gonna do a couple things The first thing it does is it breaks us out of the function. So whatever we put that return keyword It's gonna break us out of the function and it's gonna return this value back to the caller So down here we can actually call this function so actually what I want to do is I want to print out the answer that we get back so I can do printf and (1:47:32) in here, I'm just gonna say Answer and we'll print out the answer.",

So normally like in the past in this course what we wanted to print on a number we'd have to put like 4 or (1:48:00) 76 or you know, whatever we'd have to put a number right there But we can just call this function because eventually this is going to get a number back anyway So this will contain a number after the functions done being called So I can actually just run my program now and this is going to print out the result of cubing 3.",

Why don't we do 7? So let's run this again and we get 343 I'm guessing that's right So basically what we did is we created this function and we use this return keyword and we returned back to the caller The value of cubing the number and that's really cool And actually we can make this a lot simpler so I could actually just get rid of this Result variable and I could just straight up return (1:49:01) Num cubed and this is and this is gonna do the same exact thing so we should get the same answer. Yeah So this can be really awesome And one thing I want to point out is this return keyword will actually break us out of the function So if I came down here and I said like printf and I printed out like here This actually this code is actually never gonna get executed.",

(1:49:34)  So whenever C sees this return keyword, it just exits the function and goes back down here to the normal program So just keep in mind that you can't really put any code after you use this return keyword because it will break you out of the function and actually want to talk to You guys about one more thing really quick you'll notice up here I'm creating my cube function above the main function.",

(2:03:06)  So Now we're gonna end up renting out false because both of these guys are false So you can see down here. We're saying false. So the difference between and and or when we have and like this Both of these conditions have to be true in order for the whole thing to be true and for us to execute this code When we have or only one of these guys has to be true so that's kind of the difference there and I want to show you guys a couple other things that we can use so Over here we're using like a less than sign (2:03:24) so for example If 3 is less than 2 I can also use a greater than sign I could use the less than or equal to sign.",

Let's run this and you'll see that we get true (2:03:54) So yeah, there you go. One more thing. I want to show you is how we can negate an entire Operation. So for example, if I said 3 is greater than 2 this is gonna be true right so we'd end up printing out true down here because 3 is greater than 2 but I could surround this whole thing with Parentheses and I could put an exclamation point right before this and this is called the negation operator and it's basically going to negate Whatever this ends up being so this is true And we put this negation operator here this whole thing is going to be false.",

But because we're negating it now, it's gonna end up being true So when I run my program you can see that we get true So that's sort of the basics of using if statements and I cover just about everything that you can do We can use ands, we can use all these different comparison operators We can use ORS and we can use this exclamation point to negate something In this tutorial I'm going to teach you guys how to build a calculator in see have you been following along with this course?

So basically like they can just guess every single number and eventually they're gonna get it, right, you know So why don't we do this?

I think three guesses is a pretty good limit and finally we want to create one more variable and this is also gonna be an integer and I'm just gonna call this out of guesses and I'm gonna set out of guesses equal to zero and out of guesses will basically Tell us whether or not the user has any more guesses and this might not be super clear what this is doing right now But keep following with the video and you'll see how this comes into play.",

So it's the same exact program doing the same exact thing and that's why for loops are great because we can take that little Structure like where we have an indexing variable and we can use it with something like this so I want to show you another situation where these four loops can come in handy and We can use them to loop through all the elements inside of an array so actually up here I have this array that I created.",

I can just use the variable names and that's why C is awesome because it allows us to do stuff like that But when C and when our computer wants to access these values it has to use these memory addresses (3:13:14) and so that's why these are useful and When we're programming and C it can actually be pretty useful to be able to know the Addresses like the actual physical addresses of these certain variables in memory So a lot of times in C when we want to work with these Variables we can just refer to them by name and we can do all sorts of stuff with them We can access them we can modify them.",

So I just said in age and Inside of this integer. I'm storing a whole number I'm storing an integer right third And if you've been following along with this course in the last tutorial We talked about memory addresses and we talked about how all of these variables are actually storing these values at (3:16:40) Physical addresses on our computer's memory so down here I have this print statement and I'm just printing out ages memory address and I'm using this percent P and I'm just printing out Ampersand age and we talked about how this ampersand when I put this in front of the variable basically It's going to give me the physical address in memory where this variable in other words where this Thermia value is stored.",

Today  we kind of give for granted that we can run a program written on a Mac on Windows or Linux, perhaps using Node.js or Python. Once upon a time, this was not the case at all.

It's just a convention. The variable is initialized at the 0 value, and the first iteration is done.

While loops While loops  is simpl er to write than a  for  loop, because it requires a bit more work on your part. === Page 29/60 ===  28Instead of defining all the loop data up front when you start the loop, like you do in the  for  loop, using  while  you just check for a condition: while (i < 10) {    }  This assumes that  i  is already defined and initialized with a value.

Before, let me introduce  do while. 6.3. Do while loops While loops are great, but there might be times when you need to do one particular thing: you want to always execute a block, and then maybe  repeat it. This is done using the  do while  keyword, in a way that's very similar to a  while  loop, but slightly different:  === Page 30/60 ===  29int i = 0;    do {    /* do something */       i++;  } while (i < 10);  The bloc k that contains the  /* do something */  comment is always executed at least once, regardless of the condition check at the bottom.

The interesting thing about C arrays is that all elements of an array are stored sequentially, one right after another. Not something that normally happens with higher-level programming languages. Another interesting thing is this: the variable name of the array,  prices  in the above example, is a pointer  to the first elem ent of the array, and as such can be used like a normal pointer.

Why? This is because the last character in a string must be a  0  value, the string terminator, and we must make space for it. This is important to keep in mind especially when manipulating strings.
